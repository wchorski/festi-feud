				<p>
					Welcome to Festival Feud, where we surveyed 100 devoted festival-goers
					to find out what REALLY goes down when the bass drops and the good
					vibes roll! From mud-caked wellies to those "unique" porta-potty
					experiences, from sunset sets that hit different to the snacks that
					fuel your dance marathon—we've got ALL the answers real festies gave
					us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two teams, one stage, and a whole lot of glitter still stuck in places
					it shouldn't be. Can you guess what's on the board? Let's find out if
					you REALLY know festival culture, or if you're still stuck in the
					parking lot trying to find your campsite! LET'S! PLAY! FESTIVAL! FEUD!
